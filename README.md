# Drag and Drop File Upload (React)

This project is a simple drag-and-drop file upload feature built using React. It allows users to drag and drop files into a designated area or select files using a file input to upload them. The project uses basic React functionality and modern JavaScript to handle file uploads efficiently.

## Features

- **Drag and Drop Support:** Easily drag and drop files into the upload area.
- **File Input Support:** Option to select files using the traditional file input.
- **File List Display:** Shows the uploaded files in a list.
- **Responsive Design:** The drag-and-drop area is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

- **React:** Frontend framework for building the UI components.
- **CSS:** Used for styling the drag-and-drop area and file list.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Logic for handling file uploads and events.
- **HTML5:** Markup for the page structure.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

         git clone https://github.com/your-username/dragDrop.git
      
         Navigate to the project directory:
         
         cd dragDrop
         Install dependencies: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
         
         
         npm install
         Start the development server:
         
         
         npm start
         Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the application running.


## Usage
Drag and drop one or more files into the drag-and-drop area, or click the area to select files from your device.
Once files are selected or dropped, they will be displayed in the file list.
The project can be further extended to handle file uploads to a server.
